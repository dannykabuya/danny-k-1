    <p> Life is a wonderful gift and people are amazing ...</p>
    <p> You know man sacrifices his health to make money. </p>
    <p> Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health.  </p>
    <p> And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present. </p>
    <p> So he does not live in the present or in the future.  </p>
    <p> He lives as if he is never going to die, and he dies having really never lived. </p>

    <br>
    
    <p> We have a limited amount of days on earth.</p>
    <p> Plan for the future, but live and enjoy every moment in the present.</p>
